## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted plum (#4A394D) to evoke sophistication and creativity, avoiding overly bright fashion cliches.
- Background color: Very light gray-plum (#F1EFF2), nearly white, aligning with the primary hue but significantly desaturated for a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Deep red-violet (#871F78), contrasting with the primary in both brightness and saturation, analogous on the color wheel to add emphasis to key UI elements like CTAs.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif providing a modern yet slightly warm and accessible feel for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent different clothing categories and styles.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout for easy navigation and visual consistency.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as a smooth image loading indicator and fluid style suggestion reveals.
